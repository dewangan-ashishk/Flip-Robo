27,5.0,Terrific purchase,"Just blown away with this beast machine!
After using for 2 days here is my review-

Pros:
1) Beautiful colour accurate screen. The resolution of 2k also makes so much sense in its 15.6 inch screen.
2) The Ryzen 5900HS is blazingly fast.
3) Amazing large trackpad made of glass!
4) The RTX 3060 can play any games on this machine with ease. The frame rates at high graphics setting do not budge.
5) 1 TB SSD is so fast. In just blink of an eye the machine boots up and shuts down.
6) The form facto...

28,1.0,Nothing special,"The product is very good in some aspects but very bad at some, which will irritate you and make you question why did you even buy this.
For me they are following:
1) Trackpad: it is good, but click is so stiff, and when I press hard for clicking, the deck flexes
2) Sleep: This laptop does not support S3 sleep, it goes to modern sleep, so it will be powered on and get heated when in sleep.
3) Speakers: All reviewers are saying that bass is good on this laptop, but I am still able to hear any b...

29,4.0,Worth the money,"Well you already know about the specs and they are pretty much top of the line. I would mostly like to say how nice the form factor is about this laptop. It's just the right size, unlike most gaming laptops which are too chunky! It also a very premium feel too it and the display is ridiculously good. Go for it, don't even give another thought if you are looking for something which has a minimalist look and a very premium feel. There were no reviews when I bought it but I'm so glad that I did!",Laptop
30,5.0,Just wow!,"The delivery service from Flipkart was very good. Just took 2 days to deliver, so 5 stars for that.

I have been testing out the laptop for my work and it has been a beast. Adobe suite runs like butter, and the preview for after effects animation also runs much better than most machines. I'm not much of a gamer but csgo runs beautifully on this device even on high frame rate.
The speakers are excellent, just a step below the MacBook speakers. Easily the best in gaming laptops.

I have opened numerous multitasking on first day, did some office work and some light poker on adda52 and baazi apps. All worked without a issue.

35,4.0,Nice product,"After using more than a month, my honest review is as follows..

The laptop is good for students taking online classes, or watching webseries or for work from home guys working in chrome or other light softwares.

Not meant for heavy gaming.

For coder programmers, the laptop is good, can manage to run xampp, VS,.net etc with little slow in performance.

No heating issue till now.

The battery is about 5-6 hours and 6+ on low brightness mode.

Cons-
-Speakers are not loud compared to others,

-Charger comes from an other Chinese company (135watt),

Bought this laptop for coding and some casual gaming. I haven't seen any major issues till now. Display is good, build is decent, performance is top notch and battery backup is great unlike other gaming laptops.

16gb ram is more than enough

The downside is the display in the bright light. Too reflective, though this was not a dealbreaker for me as I use an external display. If display is a must for you, you can check other opinions too.
Having said that, display is not bad either but just a bit too reflective for outdoor usage.",Laptop

Pros:
1. SSD is fast. I've used only HDD before so this was the first thing I noticed.
2. Temperatures are usually <60C for both GPU and CPU for light use. Note that this has only one fan but it is unbelievable how cool this system stays even in no air conditioning rooms.
3. Pretty lightweight. Just marvel at how much this is packing but in so little space.

3rd - GPU is severely underperforming even for a 3050 thanks to it being limited to 40 Watt TDP, 3050 can have max TDP of 80 Watt and achieve much higher clock speed, 60-65 Watt power should have been fine with 2 fans a...

Battery backup is 2 hours max for heavy GPU use.(Gaming and editing)
For normal use it gives 6 hours - 8 hours backup.

Pros - Awesome display, super touchscreen, superior / fast response

Cons - This comes with MS Office student 2019 version where outlook is not there. If you are habituated for MS outlook for any business mails, you would get disappointed.

After using for 2 days here is my review-

Pros:
1) Beautiful colour accurate screen. The resolution of 2k also makes so much sense in its 15.6 inch screen.

3) Amazing large trackpad made of glass!
4) The RTX 3060 can play any games on this machine with ease. The frame rates at high graphics setting do not budge.

For me they are following:
1) Trackpad: it is good, but click is so stiff, and when I press hard for clicking, the deck flexes
2) Sleep: This laptop does not support S3 sleep, it goes to modern sleep, so it will be powered on and get heated when in sleep.

It's just the right size, unlike most gaming laptops which are too chunky! It also a very premium feel too it and the display is ridiculously good. Go for it, don't even give another thought if you are looking for something which has a minimalist look and a very premium feel.

The speakers are excellent, just a step below the MacBook speakers. Easily the best in gaming laptops.

1650Ti (8-10% more efficient than 1650)

Cooling (better because all air vents are open)

I was confused b/w Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3, Asus Tuf F15 & this one.
I suggest you to buy hdd+ssd Or ssd. There is only 3k difference between 512gb ssd and 1 tb hdd variant.

*The system is smooth and steady .
*Not very colour accurate screen tho it's it's excellent for the price .
*144 hz does helps in browsing etc .

* Run a few game - highly recommend to upgrade the ram to 16 or 32 for better gaming .

6233,5.0,Just wow!,"Apple Mac has a class in it's own, simply outstanding!! The Big Billion Days offer makes it an even crazy deal. Great improvement from the last gen Mac, it now gets a crisper screen with less bezels and looks a lot more premium. You must use it to experience it.

6234,5.0,Classy product,"Migrated from 2016 MacBook Air. Brand new, sealed pack product, authentic product was delivered by Flipkart. Transition from old laptop was very smooth. Best in class Laptop. Super happy with the Retina Screen, new speaker system, butterfly smooth key board, long battery life. Only thing that could have helped more is one USB port, I had to buy an USB type C to Type A extender separately.",Laptop
6235,5.0,Fabulous!,"So, this is my first experience with a MacBook. In the past the MacBook Air was considered an underperforming notebook for a very high price. But now because of the m1 chip the performance is incredible for all the apps that can be run on the relatively new platform. Only thing is if you need more RAM or storage, pls upgrade before buying because all parts are soldered into the motherboard so you cannot upgrade it in the future. For me 8gb ram and 256 go ssd is more than enough",Laptop
6236,5.0,Wonderful,First experience of an Apple product and it's totally worth it so far. Been using it on and off from past week(1hr per day average. Yet haven't required to charge the laptop) all general stuff like MSO and everything is working perfectly. Overall I'm very impressed I can say.,Laptop
6237,5.0,Highly recommended,"It feels like magic!

6269,5.0,Super!,Bought it on flipkart big billion days. Initial impressions are good so far but it does heats up when you do some gaming. It mainly occurs because of the absence of cooling fan. But for normal daily usage and tasks it is a BEAST. I opened around 30-40 safari tabs and around 15 apps at the same time still i was able to switch between apps without any lags and it was buttery smooth.

CONS:

3. 30W charger maybe slow for some.
4. You will crave for the glowing logo but it's not there.
5. Soldered 256gig SSD.

1. Lightweight
2. Great build and Design
3. Backlight keyboard
4. Fingerprint scanner is fast
5. Beautiful 2k display
6. Speakers are bonkers
7. Great battery life

Cons:
1. i5 variant is bit pricey, i3 is bang for buck
2. Even though the PORTS situation is sorted with 3 USB C and 1 USB 3.1, a HDMI and sd card slot would have been cheery on the cake

Got it for 41k during BBD sale and can say, easily the best laptop for MY needs.

Loved it.",Laptop

By replacing ram with 1x8 you can expect 25fps more in eSports title and 10 15fps in AAA title depending on game and by using external monitor you can expect 5 -8% boost .Rest all is great for the price.

The laptop gives decent performance in the current AAA titles at high to ultra settings, but sub-par performance in RTX enabled games.
GPU is handicapped due to low TDP of 75 watts. But still better than 1660Ti or high powered 3050 Ti.
CPU by nature tends to run hotter compared to current gen Ryzen CPUs, but undervolting can solve the problem to some extent at the expense of some performance.

Display- Display is pretty decen according to the price as every laptop in this price range uses same kind of LCD display if you are going to use this laptop for photo or video editing where color accuracy is really important then you have to buy an exernal monitor or you have to go with higher end laptop which give 100% sRGB value. For my usage I find this display good...

Moreover the laptop has it all as it says in its description. The screen being 60 Hz is still Superb. The RGB keyboard is its USP as no other laptop has it, even in a segment higher than this. The operations seems smooth to me and quite manageable. The RAM is adapt for the usage but one ca always upgrade it. The memory is sufficient and can also be up...

11080,4.0,Nice product,"Writing this after 10days of use and would like to point out some things.
1. The battery life is good for such a machine. Im getting around 5 hours while normal browsing and simple tasks. Amd ryzen5 is a 7nm chip so less power consumption.
2. The display is good and you wont feel anything unless you go nick picking the faults. Yes the colour accuracy isnt great, but one wont notice in regular usage.
3. Good thermals. Doesn't heat up unnecessary under normal usage.
4. The keyboard is on the ha...

11089,5.0,Super!,Best laptop under the budget. At first I was confused because I was buying the first expansive thing from Flipkart and I couldn't wait to get my laptop.

If you are using for gaming and office use this is the best option you can get.

60hz panel is good since the fps won't get 100+ in 1650 so 144hz is more or less a marketing gimmick.

Ryzen 5 variant is more powerful than i5 11th gen.

For initial use 8 GB ram is enough even if you are planning to play games like doom eternal it can give you decent 60 fps at combination of high and ultra settings.


Overall product is good but flipkart services are pathetic...

11092,5.0,Wonderful,"It is absolutely a beast. The ryzen processor is very fast and handles all the tasks smoothly. The nvidia graphics is very good. The sound quality is above average and you get clear audio. The four zone RGB backlit keyboard is super pretty and looks amazing in the dark. The full hd screen is anti glare and has zero screen bleeding. Also, no heating problem so far.",Laptop
11093,5.0,Fabulous!,"This is an amazing laptop with enough vents for a proper air ventilation that helps in preventing the laptop from heating.

The biggest disadvantage of this laptop is its speakers. The inbuilt speakers are not loud enough even at the highest volume. A good external speaker or a home theater, however, would offer promising sound effects when integrated with the DTS surround sound system present in the laptop.

The looks and performance of Acer Nitro 5 is outstanding. I've had smooth gaming exp...

The downside is the display in the bright light. Too reflective, though this was not a dealbreaker for me as I use an external display. If display is a must for you, you can check other opinions too.

First I had a confusion with Mi Notebook 14 and Nokia purebook. After some research, I went for Nokia.
The only better thing in MI Notebook when compared to this is the 2GB GPU.

The best highlights of this laptop is the weight and looks. Even though the laptop is not from the Nokia (flipkart is the manufacturer), the Nokia brand name on the laptop looks classy.

Truly amazing to see that this laptop handles all the apps that you throw at it.

1. Ordered in the 1st week of July. Found out that usb c port does not work at all (only good for charging).

If anything goes wrong, say goodbye to your money and laptop for ~2 months.
Only thing worse than Flipkart's customer policy is Lenovo's lackadaisical attitude to device defects.

The downside is the display in the bright light. Too reflective, though this was not a dealbreaker for me as I use an external display. If display is a must for you, you can check other opinions too.

To anyone buying this specific model of the IdeaPad for somewhat moderate to hardcore gaming. I would recommend getting an additional 8GB ram stick to install into the stock laptop. It doesn't do much to provide greater FPS but basically allows your GPU to perform to the best of its ability without any sudden FPS drops or hanging and stuttering. This really makes a difference in games like COD warzone and is worth the investment. So purchasing this ...

13900,1.0,Please avoid the purchase,"Avoid the device. The display is not just bad. it is ultra bad.
Even for things like Google Meet, if you enable background which the kids will do, the CPU usage reaches 100% and the machine hangs.
Please buy a good tab for kids vs this so called laptop.
Whatever branding or stuff, this is a seriously bad product. How Google allows such kind of products in the market, i fail to understand.
