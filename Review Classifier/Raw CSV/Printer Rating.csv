0,5.0,Perfect product!,"Very nice printer, is worth the purchase. Ideal for Home printing but the black cartridge prints hardly 100 Pages and same with Color cartridge.The cartridge price is costly so I suggest you to Buy GoColor Canon compatible ink's each bottle is of 100 ML and you will find that there's is difference between Original and GoColor ink's. You can refill the cartridge at home in the kit you get everything just watch a video on YouTube and you will save you 96% Printing cost. I have done the same thi...

13,4.0,Worth the money,"So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details .
The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes .
Yes buying the ink will be expensive .
Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.",Printer
14,5.0,Terrific purchase,"PROS:
1. Available at cheap price.
2. Decent for less amount of printing.
3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.

CONS:
1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included.
2. Print speed is too slow.
3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.

Suggestion:
Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink!
Happy Printing :)",Printer

17,4.0,Nice product,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good.
Cartidge is costly.
After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart.",Printer
18,2.0,Decent Product,"Pros:
1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot

Cons:
1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time
2. Makes lot of noise while printing.

Verdict:
You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...

23,5.0,Good printer in Low Budget,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.

After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.

Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.

Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart.",Printer

42,2.0,Better not to buy.,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy.
Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day.",Printer
43,2.0,Not good,"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-.

Price is also affordable. No dought about product. But cartridege is very costly. only 50-60 prints in one black cartridge. Cartridege price is near about Rs. 1000/- . For 50-60 prints Rs.1000/- is not economical. Company has to solve this cartridge problem. Cartridge prices should be very cheap.,Printer

My advice NEVER buy an Epson printer coz they just do not have a supply-chain in place. It takes 10 to 15 days to get a cartridge. So if you run out of ink, start chasing the suppliers every 24 hours, till you get a cartridge in 10 days or less. I have junked my 4 month old printer for a different brand.

7545,2.0,Better not to buy.,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy.
Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day.",Printer

Very Poor Software offered by HP. Every document scans Twice for the reason unknown to me. Canon E500 that I used earlier had a lot better scanner than this one.

The best one being able to make a single PDF file out of multiple documents or photos. Scanning is great and quick. Easy to use and install. However flipkart let me down by sending the wrong serial number in the invoice. This has been rectified now. Over all its a great product and if you can shell out a few more rupees, go for PIXMA e510. Also I received a 5%...

14755,5.0,Simply awesome,"Recommended to all. This review after using few years. I had purchased this product on 5th March 2019 and the review date 1st July 2021. No issues for printing.

Epson genuine ink cost approx 400 per bottle but the ink help for better printing results, printer life.",Printer
