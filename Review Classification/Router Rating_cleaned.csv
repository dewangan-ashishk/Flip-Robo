3STAR is because 5ghz range is very low. Please note that it says 1200mbps output in the model AC5 but the input speed is only upto 100mbps. This, it won't give speed more than 100mbps.
If you have plan with 150mbps or higher, go for AC8 model.

6730,3.0,Faced minor issues,"It's a very decent router. Has good features as 3 detachable antennas, USB 3.0, gigabit Ethernet port. Range is OK type for 1000 - 1200 sqft apartments.
