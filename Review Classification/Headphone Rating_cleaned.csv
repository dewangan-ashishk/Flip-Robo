Issue 2. I use realme 3 pro so the bluetooth version is up to date but it barely gives 5ish meters range (LOS) and about 7ish meters with laptop.

Issue 3. The left and right earbuds consumes battery differently for some reason. When I use it for some time (lets's say 4 hours) I am left with 50% battery in right one and 30% in left one.

These are deal breaking issues which makes me wonder if this thing ...
