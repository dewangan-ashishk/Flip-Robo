Better go for Laser Jet Printers with Toner cartridges.",Printer

Scanning is very fast and silent too.
Cheap price

Cons:
Very cheap Material used in manufacturing.
Opening the covers for replacing Toner is a horrible experience.
When you open the cover, it makes cracking noise, as something is broken, but don't worry, All izz Well.

But the finishing of the product is terrible. The front & top faces are fine but the back & inner portions are terribly casted. Also the scanner tray is not so rigid.
